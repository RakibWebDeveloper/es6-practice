# ES6 Practice

## let, const, var
  - var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
  - var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
  - They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
  - While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

## Default Parameter
  - In JavaScript, function parameters default to undefined. However, it's often useful to set a different default value. This is where default parameters can help.
  - Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.

## Template String
  - Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (` `)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes.
