# ES6 Practice

## let, const, var
  - var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped.
  - var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
  - They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized.
  - While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

## Default Parameter
  - In JavaScript, function parameters default to undefined. However, it's often useful to set a different default value. This is where default parameters can help.
  - Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.

## Template String
  - Template literals are enclosed by the backtick (``)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes.
  

## Arrow Function
  - Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
  - Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.
  

## Spread Operator
  - Expanding Arrays
  - Combining Arrays
  - Copying Arrays and Objects

## Class
#### There are three concepts in Object-Oriented Programming Object, Class and Methods. The ES6 JavaScript supports the Object-Oriented programming components.
  - Object: A real-time object entity means the presentation of any entity in real-time.
  - Class: It is the before the plan of creating any objects which are known as blueprint of any objects which you want to create.
  - Methods: It communicates between the objects.
